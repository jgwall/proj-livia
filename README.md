Teaching Evolution with Digital Images

This is the repository for Livia, a program written by Dr. Jason Wallace at the University of Georgia to teach evolution. Livia takes a digital image and, starting from random static, evolves a population of images toward the goal based on the principles of mutation and selection. User-defined parameters determine how fast this process occurs and how close the final product is to the desired target.

Livia can be used to teach both basic and advanced evolutionary concepts, including:
* Mutation
* Selection
* Selection efficiency
* Mutation-selection balance
* Genetic drift
* The Fisher-Orr geometric model
